# Proj2-Nanodegree
Operationalizing Machine Learning for Udacity ML-Ops Nanodegree

# Overview
In this project, I used Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. I also created, published, and consumed a pipeline. 

Project main steps:
1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. Documentation

# How to Improve
The purpose of this project was to practice deploying a model, so I did not fully evaluate the results of the AutoML experiment, other than noting the description of the best model and where to find metrics and logging. To improve, I would spend more time on this step, to make sure the model performance met my business constraints, and determine if other advanced settings should be considered. For example, I could try an alternative model rather than Classification.
